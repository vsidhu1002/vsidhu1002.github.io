# Personal Website (Assignment 2)

This is a simple website made similar to a resume.

## Pages
- `index.html` = homepage (about me, education, skills, experience, contact)
- `visualizations.html` = SVG visualization portfolio

## Files
- `style.css` = site styling (dark blue + grey theme)
- `main.js` = basic homepage JavaScript file
- `vis.js` = JavaScript that generates SVG visualizations

## How to Run
Open the folder in VS Code and use Live Server:
1. Right click `index.html`
2. Click "Open with Live Server"

Then navigate using the navbar to the Visualizations page.
